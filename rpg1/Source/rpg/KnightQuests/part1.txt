You... you're not one of them, are you?
I see it in your eyes, the same emptiness I bear. You are Forsaken, just like me.
Long ago, I had a family, a life, before the Iron Clan tore it all away.
They wield their metallic powers with cruelty, crushing anyone who stands in their way.
I vowed revenge, but without power, what can one like me do?
Yet, here you stand, perhaps together we can topple the Iron Conduit and avenge the fallen.
